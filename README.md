# Justin Weather Dashboard
This Project uses a combination of Javascript, Bootstrap, and the Open Weather One Call API to create a weather dashboard.  


## Installation
Download the code and run index.html with a web browser. 
This code was tested in Google Chrome.  

Alternatively it can be found live here: https://justincode98.github.io/Justin-Weather-Dashboard/

## Usage
After running index.html, the browser should show a simple calendar app that displays the current date at the top of the page.  
The user is then able to scroll down to view time blocks for standard business hours. These time blocks can be clicked and edited, and the texts will persist through local storage  
The UV conditions are color coded.  

Severe: Red  
Moderate:  Yellow  
Favorable: Green
